																					  		<div class="modal-body">Jade Dominguez, 26, was living off credit card debt in a rental in South Pasadena, Calif., while he taught himself programming. He had been an average student in high school and hadn’t bothered with college. However, his level of programming was high enough to be picked up by algorithms Socos founder Vivienne Ming, PhD, created to find potentially talented software developers. Importantly, these algorithms assess a person’s potential not based on standardized measures such as the ones found in schools, but based on naturalistic data from the real world. And successfully so: Jade was located and hired by a software company. Unfortunately, there are millions of adults and children around the world not so fortunate to have their potentials discovered.<br><br>

																							Jade’s hiring process reveals that something extremely important happens when an individual becomes a successful autodidact – in control of his own learning process instead of passively absorbing another’s teachings. Student exhibit increases in metrics actually predictive of life outcomes that range from motivation and creativity to self-regulation and metacognitive ability (Roberts et al., 2007; Luhmann et al., 2012).<br><br>

																							Socos believes that these increases are not just limited to autodidacts, but they can be triggered by small interventions applied at the right time. It has been repeatedly demonstrated in scientific studies that small adjustments can create life-long changes. A famous example is a study for which families of severely underprivileged toddlers in Kingston, Jamaica were educated in simple nutrition, social and motivational skills. Twenty years later those individuals were found to be indistinguishable from more wealthy populations (Gertler, Heckman, et al., 2014). Those simple interventions were able to effectively erase the fact that those children came from impoverished backgrounds.

																<h5> Emotional Intelligence</h5>
																<p>In the oft-cited marshmallow study, a child’s early-life ability to delay gratification has been shown to be predictive of life-long measures of success (Mischel, Ayduk, et al., 2010). However, such interventions, when poorly designed, can have contrary effects: In a lesser-known variant of the same study, prior to being given their first marshmallow the children were promised crayons or similar enticement by an adult who did not deliver on the promise. In each case of this reneging on a promise, children ate their first marshmallow right away (Kidd, Palmeri, and Aslin, 2013). Children were trained to take what was available because they could not rely on a future promise, which has implications for the future success of those children.</p>

																<h5>Lasting Change in Socio-Economic Status</h5>
																<p> 
																	It has been repeatedly demonstrated in scientific studies that small adjustments can create life-long changes. A famous example is a study of families of severely underprivileged toddlers in Kingston, Jamaica.  Families were identified in a government program, and once each month for three years the parents were educated in simple nutrition, social and motivational skills. Twenty years later the children from those families were studied by a group of economists and found to be indistinguishable from more wealthy populations (Gertler, Heckman, et al., 2014). Those simple interventions were able to effectively erase the fact that those children came from impoverished backgrounds.</p>

																<h5>Health Implications of Minor Interventions</h5>
																<p>Similar impacts from low-grade interventions were found in addressing health problems of children from families of low socioeconomic status in the United States. Eight years after the interventions, the youth who participated had significantly fewer health problems than controls (Miller, Chen, et al., 2013).
																Socioeconomic status and health have been demonstrably impacted as the result of small interventions. There is even more potential for impact when processes are triggered that are relevant for successful learning. In fact, the reason why these interventions are so effective is that they target personality characteristics such as persistence, motivation, and mindset, which prove to be key to development and life-outcomes (Yeager, Walton, and Cohen, 2013).   </p>

																	<h5>Meta-Learning </h5>
																<p>Characteristics like the ability to delay gratification in the marshmallow study are relevant to “21st Century Skills.” These learnable skills include creative problem solving, critical thinking, and collaboration, and are important to aspects of life (Pellegrino & Hilton, 2013; Binkley, Erstad, et al., 2012). Students and professionals would benefit if these complex skills were studied in schools and taught in the workplace. Unfortunately, educational systems fail to teach to these goals, instead focusing on training domain-specific knowledge under the assumptions that these more complex skills will come about naturally. Specific knowledge is valuable, but in the modern era information is abundant and relevant knowledge changes very quickly. What actually matters most is the ability to learn whatever new information may be important, and to use it productively.</p>

															<h5>Human Capital</h5>
																<p> 
																	Education requires direct human participation. Parents, caregivers, colleagues, and teachers all play an important role in a learner’s development. This includes education in nurtuant parenting (Gertler, Heckman, et al., 2014), implicit education which fosters a growth mindset (Dweck, 2006), and positive framing and affirmation (Cohen & Sherman, 2014). Socos is building on pre-existing research, but mainly in the realm of "hand analysis" of complex data. One study that demonstrates that how students take notes over several weeks of a course is highly reflective of self-regulated learning aspects (Glogger, Schwonke, et al., 2012). Socos will be using the demonstrated importance of human participation in education to further the goal of lifetime outcomes.</p>

																	<h5>Naturalistic Interventions</h5>
																<p>Technology is sufficiently advanced that algorithms can accurately predict lifetime outcomes. When that information is provided recursively to the students and teachers it becomes actionable. However, the current integration of technological assessments occur in tightly regulated environments. While they might provide flexibility in their assessment strategies, they can only do so by offloading standardization onto the environment. The solution proposed by Socos is to take naturalistic student experiences and perform predictive assessment on lifelong outcome. In the case studies previously described, lifelong outcomes of test subjects were changes by slight alterations to their environment. Children denied crayons immediately ate their first marshmallow and parents given weekly interventions in Jamaica raised children indistinguishable from less socioeconomically limited families. Minor real-world interventions have a major impact. </p>

														<h5>One of the most fundamental challenges in teaching is peering inside students' heads and figuring out what they're thinking. While education is a field rich with data, obtaining high-quality data and processing them meaningfully and efficiently remains difficult. Whether in formal classes, individualized tutoring, or casual web queries, learners continually generate questions, comments, proposals, discussions and a multitude of other assessable work. <br><br>These constitute valuable assessment data for informing instructors’ professional judgment, but systematically analyzing them across multiple students and time-points demands attention and resources beyond what most teachers can spare. The quantity of possible data to track defies ambition. The vast majority is lost to any broader perspective for instructors, educational leaders, and decision-makers. Lessons go untried, assessments unvalidated, population trends undetected and teaching opportunities missed. Rather than constantly designing and administering new tests, education needs tools which can actually make intelligent use of existing data.</h5>

			   Interventions in early childhood are of great interest as they can have significant impacts down the road (Karoly, Kilburn, et al., 2006). However, interest in improving early childhood learning across school and home settings is colliding with movements to increase standardized testing at younger ages. While testing proponents are rightfully concerned about measuring children’s learning, the design and use carry many problems. Tests are valid only for the population and purpose for which they were designed; eliminating cultural bias from tests is extremely difficult; and tests are often designed as sequestered experiences stripped from authentic contexts. Standardization narrows the range for what is considered acceptable progress regardless of developmental variation, and testing is intrusive, displacing instruction which might yield better learning. <br><br>

			    Working with researchers at University of Texas at Austin, Socos is building an alternative method for assessing young children’s linguistic and metacognitive development in richer detail and more naturalistic contexts. The new system extends our existing assessment algorithm for adult learners to deliver rapid, actionable feedback for parents, teachers, and caregivers based on the broad range of learning experiences already taking place in the classroom and at home. In academic studies, Socos has successfully predicted final grades by analyzing unstructured student text in online discussion forums, which also yielded preliminary topic maps that could be used to trace different trajectories in student thinking.  <br><br>

				Analysis of young children’s linguistic experiences from audio recordings have demonstrated the feasibility of automatically tracking word exposure and adult- child conversational turns. We are in the process of deploying similar technology throughout kindergarteners’ learning environment in conjunction with location data and analyze them with our continuous passive assessment algorithms. We are producing a map of the conceptual space of young learners with which we can explore the predictive value of the individual language experience, including self-generated as well as child-to-child and adult-to-child speech in each language. Combined with student artifacts and information about classroom activities, these data sources would serve as multiple inputs illuminating students’ knowledge and skill that can then be connected with externally validated assessment outcomes. By distinguishing between what students generate and what students experience, the predictive system further elucidates school and home interventions with the greatest potential to boost learning. <br><br>

				The implications of this work would be quite far-reaching: The ability to assess students’ knowledge from existing learning experiences removes the burden of testing and enables teachers to focus on instruction with the greatest learning impact. Evaluating the benefits of different experiences at school and at home would better inform teachers’ and caregivers’ choices of interventions, in addition to facilitating more productive collaboration between them. It could clarify the relative effectiveness of parental contributions in reinforcing school lessons (repeating the same language) or elaborating upon them (adding new language). It exemplifies a minimally-intrusive technological innovation that would advance what instructors know about their teaching, rather than immediately requiring drastic changes in practice. <br><br>
				
				Beyond simply increasing and enriching children’s vocabularies, supporting their linguistic development in real-world contexts directly advances their skill in using language to monitor and guide their own learning. Our system augments the critical support of caregivers through brief messages informing and guiding their interactions with the children. Our ultimate goal is not only to provide daily, personalized interventions to decrease the word gap, but to drive the development of broader lifelong meta-learning skills.

										Socos is in the early stages of a project with a new, competency-based online college, which Wired Magazine has named among the most innovative organizations in the world. This organization has taken an entirely new approach to self-directed learning. There are no grades or professors. Instead, progression through the curriculum is driven entirely by competency. Students work digitally with coaches who support students for the duration of their projects. Students’ work are then given a pass or fail by an unbiased panel of assessors...

				Socos is working with this organization to implement new approaches to direct assessment in their competency-based learning paradigm. This project continues to build on our interest in continuous passive assessment as an innovative method for real-time assessment of unstructured student work. We validate our assessment algorithms based on their ability to predict concrete outcomes such as persistence and progression, as well as mapping them to established program goals and competencies. Linking this competency map to employers’ needs can further help gauge progress in students’ career trajectories, via an adaptive guide for leveraging student strengths. By offering more timely and specific feedback based on automated analyses of student work and interactions, such a system can more effectively guide self-assessments, instructional coaching, and peer learning arrangements. <br><br>

				The optimal feedback is derived from the data of student-coach interactions (phone and email). By examining the data of student-student interaction, student-coach discussion, and student-reviewer feedback, Socos will be able to make predictions both about individual student’s future performance and provide constructive feedback to coaches and reviewers about how students may improve in school and life outcomes.<br><br>
				We will be using this data combined with comprehensive student profiles to evaluate their engagement with the school. Socos will be able to offer coaches warnings of disengagement and recommendations of known interventions.

										<h5>Online Student Discussion Predictive of Grades</h5>
										<p class="mb_50">
											Socos has conducted and published research based on online class discussion data at one of the world’s largest universities.  Socos partnered with this university and subsequently published multiple journal articles describing how grades in a course could be successfully predicted.  In academic studies, Socos has successfully predicted final grades by analyzing unstructured student text in online discussion forums, which also yielded preliminary topic maps that can be used in student thinking (Ming & Ming, 2012).

														Using only student discussion data from introductory courses in biology and economics, both probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (hLDA) produced significantly better than chance predictions which improved with additional data collected over the duration of the course. Results indicate that topic modeling of student-generated text may provide a useful source of formative assessment to support learning and instruction.<br><br>

														Our goals in this research were to identify facilitation strategies that encourage productive discussion, and to explore text mining techniques that can help discover meaningful patterns in the discussions more efficiently at scale. Based on a close reading of selected discussion threads from online undergraduate science classes, we observed a variety of facilitation strategies associated with discussion quality. These observations informed our selection of a larger dataset of discussion threads to analyze via text mining techniques. Using latent semantic analysis to produce topic models of the content of the discussions, we constructed visualizations of the topical and temporal development of those discussions among students and faculty. <br><br>These visualizations revealed patterns that appeared to correspond with specific facilitation styles and with the extent to which discussions remained focused on particular topics. From a case study focusing on six of these discussions, we documented distinct patterns in the types of facilitation strategies employed and the character of the discussions that followed. In our conclusion, we discuss potential applications of these analytical techniques for helping students, faculty, and faculty developers become more aware of their participation and influence in online discussions, thereby improving their value as a learning environment.
