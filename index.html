														<p><h5>There exists today an enormous amount of data on how students are actually learning, and workers are performing.  Simultaneously, while there is an increasing awareness of the importance of “21st Century Skills” there is little done to reinforce these traits. Socos’ solution is to take naturalistic data as the basis for our assessments. We close the educational loop by providing relevant feedback to educators on what they can do to improve life outcomes.  Socos is developing and implementing technologies that allow the learning experience to become the core of education by integrating assessment, feedback, and lifelong outcomes into one unified experience.<br><br> The implementations of these solutions require the combination of human capital and technology.    Socos is using timely feedback as a catalyst of internal processes of students that are rich resources, akin to social psychologists using interventions to just bring about a small change in a students' perspective.  This triggers very different self-perceptions and actions, enabling the student to engage in a positive feedback loop with the environment.   <br><br> The solution proposed by Socos is to take naturalistic student experiences and perform predictive assessment on lifelong outcome. In the case studies previously described, lifelong outcomes of test subjects were changes by slight alterations to their environment. Children denied crayons immediately ate their first marshmallow and parents given weekly interventions in Jamaica raised children indistinguishable from less socioeconomically limited families. Minor real-world interventions have a major impact.

								  		<div class="modal-body">Jade Dominguez, 26, was living off credit card debt in a rental in South Pasadena, Calif., while he taught himself programming. He had been an average student in high school and hadn’t bothered with college. However, his level of programming was high enough to be picked up by algorithms Socos founder Vivienne Ming, PhD, created to find potentially talented software developers. Importantly, these algorithms assess a person’s potential not based on standardized measures such as the ones found in schools, but based on naturalistic data from the real world. And successfully so: Jade was located and hired by a software company. Unfortunately, there are millions of adults and children around the world not so fortunate to have their potentials discovered.<br><br>

										Jade’s hiring process reveals that something extremely important happens when an individual becomes a successful autodidact – in control of his own learning process instead of passively absorbing another’s teachings. Student exhibit increases in metrics actually predictive of life outcomes that range from motivation and creativity to self-regulation and metacognitive ability (Roberts et al., 2007; Luhmann et al., 2012).<br><br>

										Socos believes that these increases are not just limited to autodidacts, but they can be triggered by small interventions applied at the right time. It has been repeatedly demonstrated in scientific studies that small adjustments can create life-long changes. A famous example is a study for which families of severely underprivileged toddlers in Kingston, Jamaica were educated in simple nutrition, social and motivational skills. Twenty years later those individuals were found to be indistinguishable from more wealthy populations (Gertler, Heckman, et al., 2014). Those simple interventions were able to effectively erase the fact that those children came from impoverished backgrounds.

										<h5>Marshmallow</h5>
										<p>In the often-cited Marshmallow Study, where children are given the choice between one marshmallow now and two later, it has been clearly demonstrated that early-life self-restraint is predictive of life-long measures of success. Another aspect to this study was conducted in which children, prior to being given their first marshmallow, were promised crayons or similar enticement, by an adult who did not deliver on their promise. In each case of this reneging on a promise, children in the study ate their first marshmallow right way. Children were literally trained in a few minutes of the study to take what was available now because they could not rely on a future promise.</p>

										<p> 
											Another example of feedback creating lasting outcomes occurred during an intervention in Kingston, Jamaica. Severely underprivileged toddlers were identified in a government program. For three years, social workers went to the homes of those kids once a month and intervened not with the children but with their parents. They talked to parents about nutrition and social motivational energy skills.
											 
											Twenty years later, those kids now adults, are actually studied by a group of economists; UC Berkeley and University of Chicago. What they find is that they earn 25% more in that atmosphere is that it’s not just the intervention. It’s that last time infatuated, they are generally, economically; in other words, they were able to effectively erase the fact that they were from this severely autonomous population.</p>

														<h5>One of the most fundamental challenges in teaching is peering inside students' heads and figuring out what they're thinking.

The quantity of possible data to track defies ambition. The vast majority is lost to any broader perspective for instructors, educational leaders, and decision-makers. Lessons go untried, assessments unvalidated, population trends undetected and teaching opportunities missed.

			   Interventions in early childhood are of great interest as they can have significant impacts down the road (Karoly, Kilburn, et al., 2006). However, interest in improving early childhood learning across school and home settings is colliding with movements to increase standardized testing at younger ages. While testing proponents are rightfully concerned about measuring children’s learning, the design and use carry many problems. Tests are valid only for the population and purpose for which they were designed; eliminating cultural bias from tests is extremely difficult; and tests are often designed as sequestered experiences stripped from authentic contexts. Standardization narrows the range for what is considered acceptable progress regardless of developmental variation, and testing is intrusive, displacing instruction which might yield better learning. <br><br>

			    Working with researchers at University of Texas at Austin, Socos is building an alternative method for assessing young children’s linguistic and metacognitive development in richer detail and more naturalistic contexts. The new system extends our existing assessment algorithm for adult learners to deliver rapid, actionable feedback for parents, teachers, and caregivers based on the broad range of learning experiences already taking place in the classroom and at home. In academic studies, Socos has successfully predicted final grades by analyzing unstructured student text in online discussion forums, which also yielded preliminary topic maps that could be used to trace different trajectories in student thinking.  <br><br>

				Analysis of young children’s linguistic experiences from audio recordings have demonstrated the feasibility of automatically tracking word exposure and adult- child conversational turns. We are in the process of deploying similar technology throughout kindergarteners’ learning environment in conjunction with location data and analyze them with our continuous passive assessment algorithms. We are producing a map of the conceptual space of young learners with which we can explore the predictive value of the individual language experience, including self-generated as well as child-to-child and adult-to-child speech in each language. Combined with student artifacts and information about classroom activities, these data sources would serve as multiple inputs illuminating students’ knowledge and skill that can then be connected with externally validated assessment outcomes. By distinguishing between what students generate and what students experience, the predictive system further elucidates school and home interventions with the greatest potential to boost learning. <br><br>

				The implications of this work would be quite far-reaching: The ability to assess students’ knowledge from existing learning experiences removes the burden of testing and enables teachers to focus on instruction with the greatest learning impact. Evaluating the benefits of different experiences at school and at home would better inform teachers’ and caregivers’ choices of interventions, in addition to facilitating more productive collaboration between them. It could clarify the relative effectiveness of parental contributions in reinforcing school lessons (repeating the same language) or elaborating upon them (adding new language). It exemplifies a minimally-intrusive technological innovation that would advance what instructors know about their teaching, rather than immediately requiring drastic changes in practice. <br><br>
				
				Beyond simply increasing and enriching children’s vocabularies, supporting their linguistic development in real-world contexts directly advances their skill in using language to monitor and guide their own learning. Our system augments the critical support of caregivers through brief messages informing and guiding their interactions with the children. Our ultimate goal is not only to provide daily, personalized interventions to decrease the word gap, but to drive the development of broader lifelong meta-learning skills.

			  Socos is in the early stages of a project with a new, competency-based online college, which Wired Magazine has named among the most innovative organizations in the world.<br><br>
				This organization has taken an entirely new approach to self-directed learning. There are no grades or professors. Instead, progression through the curriculum is driven entirely by competency. Students work digitally with coaches who support students for the duration of their projects. Students’ work are then given a pass or fail by an unbiased panel of assessors, and the student either moves on to the next project, or attempt the work again. Students are considered done with a specific project when they have master that competency. If they have not mastered that competency, they are given recommendations about how they might improve.<br><br>

				Socos is working with this organization to implement new approaches to direct assessment in their competency-based learning paradigm. This project continues to build on our interest in continuous passive assessment as an innovative method for real-time assessment of unstructured student work. We validate our assessment algorithms based on their ability to predict concrete outcomes such as persistence and progression, as well as mapping them to established program goals and competencies. Linking this competency map to employers’ needs can further help gauge progress in students’ career trajectories, via an adaptive guide for leveraging student strengths. By offering more timely and specific feedback based on automated analyses of student work and interactions, such a system can more effectively guide self-assessments, instructional coaching, and peer learning arrangements. <br><br>

				The optimal feedback is derived from the data of student-coach interactions (phone and email). By examining the data of student-student interaction, student-coach discussion, and student-reviewer feedback, Socos will be able to make predictions both about individual student’s future performance and provide constructive feedback to coaches and reviewers about how students may improve in school and life outcomes.<br><br>
				We will be using this data combined with comprehensive student profiles to evaluate their engagement with the school. Socos will be able to offer coaches warnings of disengagement and recommendations of known interventions.

														Using only student discussion data from introductory courses in biology and economics, both probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (hLDA) produced significantly better than chance predictions which improved with additional data collected over the duration of the course. Results indicate that topic modeling of student-generated text may provide a useful source of formative assessment to support learning and instruction.<br><br>

														Our goals in this research were to identify facilitation strategies that encourage productive discussion, and to explore text mining techniques that can help discover meaningful patterns in the discussions more efficiently at scale. Based on a close reading of selected discussion threads from online undergraduate science classes, we observed a variety of facilitation strategies associated with discussion quality. These observations informed our selection of a larger dataset of discussion threads to analyze via text mining techniques. Using latent semantic analysis to produce topic models of the content of the discussions, we constructed visualizations of the topical and temporal development of those discussions among students and faculty. <br><br>These visualizations revealed patterns that appeared to correspond with specific facilitation styles and with the extent to which discussions remained focused on particular topics. From a case study focusing on six of these discussions, we documented distinct patterns in the types of facilitation strategies employed and the character of the discussions that followed. In our conclusion, we discuss potential applications of these analytical techniques for helping students, faculty, and faculty developers become more aware of their participation and influence in online discussions, thereby improving their value as a learning environment.

													 Another example of feedback creating lasting outcomes occurred during an intervention in Kingston, Jamaica. Severely underprivileged toddlers were identified in a government program. For three years, social workers went to the homes of those kids once a month and intervened not with the children but with their parents. They talked to parents about nutrition and social motivational energy skills. 

													Twenty years later, those kids now adults, are actually studied by a group of economists; UC Berkeley and University of Chicago. What they find is that they earn 25% more in that atmosphere is that it’s not just the intervention. It’s that last time infatuated, they are generally, economically; indistinguishable for the last they thought. In other words, they were able to effectively erase the fact that they were from this severely autonomous population.

												<h5>Cognitive Analitics</h5>
												<p class="marginb_30">
													
													Using our Cognitive AnalyticsTM dashboard, a teacher can assign a lesson in-class or online, collect real-time analytics on student work, and use its intuitive visualizations to facilitate assessment and instruction. The dashboard displays learning trajectories for individual students over time and across domains by analyzing entire bodies of work. Student populations can be tracked across time and across classes. The value of specific lessons and interventions can be assessed in the context of the actual learning environment, from the level of individual students to complex subpopulations. <br /><br />

												<li class="position_2">
												<h5>Educational Data Mining</h5>
												<p class="marginb_30">
													
												Educational Dataming
												While education is a field rich with data, obtaining high-quality data and processing them meaningfully and efficiently remains difficult.
												The team at Socos can advance your development projects with individually focused research in
												Text Mining Cognitive Modeling Multi-modality data analysis Our consulting services offer our years of expertise for any large-scale analysis of your education-related data.<br /><br />
													
												</li>
												<li class="position_3">
												<h5>Adaptive Learning</h5>
												<p class="marginb_30">
													
													The three co-founders of Socos have combined their expertise in Cognition, Education and Machine Learning to develop our core Cognitive AnalyticsTM platform. It combines a set of proprietary algorithms for discovering underlying causes for student judgments with our unique Cognitive GraphTM Technology for capturing relationships connecting ideas and thinkers. The graph infers core conceptual factors underlying domains from normative sources as well as the student's own work. These factors power the analytics, providing metrics of the actual semantic content of students' work, not just word counts or time on task. Using the Cognitive Graph, instructors can quickly and easily perceive unique patterns in the understanding of individual students on specific assignments, across assignments, across domains and across time. The Graph easily extends to groups of students, allowing automated discovery of trends within and across populations. <br /><br />

											<h5>The goal of Socos is to literally make people smarter. We construct individualized models of how people think and then put these models, these virtual you’s, to work.</h5>
											<p>
												 One of the most fundamental challenges in teaching is peering inside students' heads and figuring out what they're thinking. While education is a field rich with data, obtaining high-quality data and processing them meaningfully and efficiently remains difficult. Whether in formal classes, individualized tutoring, or casual web queries, learners continually generate questions, comments, proposals, discussions and a multitude of other assessable work. These constitute valuable assessment data for informing instructors’ professional judgment, but systematically analyzing them across multiple students and time-points demands attention and resources beyond what most teachers can spare. The quantity of possible data to track defies ambition. The vast majority is lost to any broader perspective for instructors, educational leaders, and decision-makers. Lessons go untried, assessments unvalidated, population trends undetected and teaching opportunities missed. Rather than constantly designing and administering new tests, education needs tools which can actually make intelligent use of existing data.
